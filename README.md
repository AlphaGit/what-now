### Any other way you want to contribute?

This is a project done for the pure sake of it in my extra time, in a one-man team. As such, there are several roles that I won't be able to fill in, including, but not limited to:

- proof-reading
- writing
- visual design
- interaction design
- SEO
- spreading the word
- legal advising
- some other stuff...

If you want to do any of these, please do.
